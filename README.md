# Jax Convolution

This is a package in order to do convolution (non-stationary or otherwise) with Jax. 
Necessary packages are only jax and numpy. For the testing Notebook ("Convolution Package.ipynb"), Astropy is also required. 

A testnotebook offers a tutorial of the different functions shown in the code.
